# Membase for Claude — Persistent Knowledge Database Pattern

**A pattern for giving Claude Code persistent, version-controlled, self-auditing project memory using an append-only SQLite database.**

> This pattern was developed across 100+ sessions on a commercial SaaS project (Agent Red Customer Experience). It evolved from markdown-only memory into a structured database after discovering that markdown backlogs drift, context windows forget, and session boundaries lose state. The approach below is extractable to any project.

---

## The Problem

Claude Code sessions have three persistent memory challenges:

1. **Context window saturation** — Long sessions accumulate stale context that biases decisions.
2. **Session boundary amnesia** — Each new session starts cold. CLAUDE.md and MEMORY.md help, but they're unstructured and drift over time.
3. **Undetected regression** — When code changes break previously-verified behavior, there's no automated signal unless you have tests that specifically check for it.

The markdown-only approach (CLAUDE.md + MEMORY.md + topic files) works well for the first ~20 sessions. After that, the files grow unwieldy, contradictions accumulate, and there's no machine-verifiable way to know if what Claude "remembers" is still true.

---

## Architecture Overview

```
project/
  CLAUDE.md                    # Rules, patterns, procedures (HOW to work)
  memory/MEMORY.md             # Current state, recent sessions (WHAT happened)
  tools/knowledge-db/
    db.py                      # Append-only SQLite API (~800 lines)
    knowledge.db               # The database (auto-created)
    seed.py                    # Initial data loader
    assertions.py              # Machine-verifiable checks (~280 lines)
    app.py                     # Read-only web UI (~230 lines)
  .claude/
    hooks/
      assertion-check.py       # SessionStart hook: run assertions + inject handoff
      scheduler.py             # UserPromptSubmit hook: process scheduled prompts
    settings.local.json        # Hook registration
    SCHEDULE.md                # Pre-planned prompts (FIFO queue)
```

### Core Principle: Append-Only

No rows are ever updated or deleted. Every change creates a new versioned record with `changed_by`, `changed_at`, and `change_reason`. Current state = latest version per ID (via SQL views). This gives you:

- **Full audit trail** — Every status change, every correction, every assertion result is preserved.
- **No accidental data loss** — Claude can't accidentally destroy information.
- **Blame tracking** — `changed_by` + `change_reason` tell you exactly why each change happened.

---

## Step 1: Create the Database Module

Create `tools/knowledge-db/db.py`. The core schema has 5 tables:

### Tables

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `specifications` | Work items / features with versioned status tracking |
| `test_procedures` | Test procedure definitions and execution history |
| `operational_procedures` | SOPs, deployment procedures, repeatable processes |
| `assertion_runs` | History of machine-verifiable assertion executions |
| `session_prompts` | Event-sourced session handoff prompts |

### Key Design Decisions

```sql
-- Every table uses the same versioning pattern:
CREATE TABLE specifications (
    rowid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    id TEXT NOT NULL,              -- e.g. "245" or "245.1" for sub-specs
    version INTEGER NOT NULL,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    priority TEXT,                 -- e.g. "P0", "P1", "P2"
    scope TEXT,                    -- grouping / module scope
    section TEXT,                  -- logical section within the project
    handle TEXT,                   -- short mnemonic (e.g. "max-turns-align")
    tags TEXT,                     -- JSON array of tags for filtering
    status TEXT NOT NULL,          -- specified | implemented | verified | retired
    assertions TEXT,               -- JSON array of machine-verifiable checks
    changed_by TEXT NOT NULL,      -- 'claude' or 'seed'
    changed_at TEXT NOT NULL,      -- ISO 8601 UTC
    change_reason TEXT NOT NULL,   -- Human-readable explanation
    UNIQUE(id, version)
);

-- Current state = latest version per ID (SQL view)
CREATE VIEW current_specifications AS
SELECT s.* FROM specifications s
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT id, MAX(version) AS max_v
    FROM specifications GROUP BY id
) m ON s.id = m.id AND s.version = m.max_v;
```

**Numbering:** Spec IDs support decimal notation for sub-specs (e.g., `245`, `245.1`, `245.1.3`). This allows hierarchical decomposition without losing traceability.

**Indexes:** Add indexes on frequently-queried columns for performance as the database grows:

```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_specs_id ON specifications(id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_specs_status ON specifications(status);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_specs_version ON specifications(id, version);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_specs_changed_at ON specifications(changed_at);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_assertion_runs_spec ON assertion_runs(spec_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_test_procs_id ON test_procedures(id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_session_prompts_session ON session_prompts(session_id);
```

### Python API Pattern

```python
class KnowledgeDB:
    """Append-only knowledge database. Claude is the sole writer."""

    _UNSET = object()  # Sentinel: distinguishes "not provided" from "set to None"

    def __init__(self, db_path=None):
        self.db_path = db_path or Path(__file__).parent / "knowledge.db"
        self._conn = None
        self._ensure_schema()

    def _get_conn(self):
        if self._conn is None:
            self._conn = sqlite3.connect(str(self.db_path))
            self._conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
            self._conn.execute("PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL")  # Safe for concurrent reads
        return self._conn

    def get_spec(self, spec_id):
        """Get latest version of a spec."""
        row = self._get_conn().execute(
            "SELECT * FROM current_specifications WHERE id = ?", (spec_id,)
        ).fetchone()
        return dict(row) if row else None

    def update_spec(self, spec_id, changed_by, change_reason, **kwargs):
        """Create new version with changes. Append-only — never modifies existing rows.

        Uses _UNSET sentinel to distinguish "not provided" from "explicitly set to None":
            update_spec("245", ..., description=KnowledgeDB._UNSET)  # keeps current
            update_spec("245", ..., description=None)                # sets to NULL
        """
        current = self.get_spec(spec_id)
        if not current:
            raise ValueError(f"Spec {spec_id} not found")
        next_version = current["version"] + 1
        # Merge: use new value if provided, else keep current
        columns = [k for k in current if k != "rowid"]
        merged = {}
        for col in columns:
            if col in kwargs and kwargs[col] is not self._UNSET:
                merged[col] = kwargs[col]
            else:
                merged[col] = current[col]
        merged["version"] = next_version
        merged["changed_by"] = changed_by
        merged["changed_at"] = datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()
        merged["change_reason"] = change_reason
        # Serialize assertions if provided as Python object (avoid double-encoding)
        if "assertions" in kwargs and not isinstance(merged["assertions"], str):
            merged["assertions"] = json.dumps(merged["assertions"])
        # Insert new version row
        cols = ", ".join(columns)
        placeholders = ", ".join(["?"] * len(columns))
        values = [merged[c] for c in columns]
        self._get_conn().execute(
            f"INSERT INTO specifications ({cols}) VALUES ({placeholders})", values
        )
        self._get_conn().commit()

    def export_json(self, output_path=None):
        """Full logical backup as JSON. Safe to run anytime."""
        # Exports all tables for archival / disaster recovery
        ...

    def close(self):
        if self._conn:
            self._conn.close()
            self._conn = None
```

### Usage in Claude Sessions

```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "tools/knowledge-db")
from db import KnowledgeDB

db = KnowledgeDB()
db.get_spec("245")                       # Latest version of spec 245
db.list_specs(status="implemented")      # All implemented specs
db.get_summary()                         # Counts by status
db.update_spec("245", changed_by="claude",
               change_reason="Verified in S42",
               status="verified")
db.export_json()                         # Full logical backup
db.close()                               # Always close when done
```

---

## Step 2: Machine-Verifiable Assertions

This is the key innovation. Each specification can have JSON assertions that Claude can run automatically:

```python
# Three assertion types:
assertions = [
    # grep — pattern must be found in file (with min_count)
    {"type": "grep", "file": "src/config.py", "pattern": "MAX_TURNS",
     "min_count": 1, "description": "Max turns constant defined"},

    # grep_absent — pattern must NOT be found in file
    {"type": "grep_absent", "file": "src/wizard.py", "pattern": "DuplicateStepName",
     "description": "Wizard doesn't duplicate sidebar content"},

    # glob — file path pattern must match at least one file
    {"type": "glob", "pattern": "admin/shared/HelpTooltip.tsx",
     "description": "HelpTooltip component exists"},
]
```

### Assertion Runner

The assertion runner (`assertions.py`) iterates all specs with assertions, runs each check, and records results in `assertion_runs`. It returns a structured summary:

```python
def run_all_assertions(db, triggered_by="manual"):
    """Run all assertions across all specs. Returns summary dict."""
    specs = db.list_specs_with_assertions()  # Only specs that have assertions
    results = []
    for spec in specs:
        parsed = json.loads(spec["assertions"])
        checks = [run_single_assertion(a) for a in parsed]
        overall_passed = all(c["passed"] for c in checks)
        # Record in assertion_runs table
        db.record_assertion_run(spec["id"], spec["version"],
                                overall_passed, checks, triggered_by)
        results.append({"spec_id": spec["id"], "title": spec["title"],
                        "overall_passed": overall_passed, "checks": checks})
    return {"passed": sum(1 for r in results if r["overall_passed"]),
            "failed": sum(1 for r in results if not r["overall_passed"]),
            "details": results}
```

### Why This Matters

Without assertions, Claude "believes" specs are implemented based on session memory. With assertions, Claude **proves** specs are implemented by checking the actual codebase. When a future code change accidentally breaks a behavior, the assertion catches it at session start.

---

## Step 3: Session Hooks

### SessionStart Hook — Assertion Check + Handoff Injection

Register in `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 .claude/hooks/assertion-check.py",
            "timeout": 15
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The hook does two things:
1. **Runs all assertions** and classifies failures as either "regressions" (implemented/verified specs now failing) or "expected" (specified but not yet implemented).
2. **Reads the session handoff prompt** stored by the previous session, so Claude automatically knows what to work on next.

```python
# Classification logic in the hook:
for failure in failures:
    spec = db.get_spec(failure["spec_id"])
    status = spec["status"]
    if status in ("implemented", "verified"):
        # REGRESSION — something broke
        regressions.append(failure)
    else:
        # Expected — not yet implemented
        expected.append(failure)
```

### UserPromptSubmit Hook — Session Scheduler

The scheduler hook (`.claude/hooks/scheduler.py`) processes pre-planned prompts from `.claude/SCHEDULE.md`. This enables deferred automation — Claude can schedule future tasks during a session that execute in subsequent sessions.

```markdown
<!-- .claude/SCHEDULE.md format -->
## Group: post-deploy-checks
trigger: always

Update staging deployment status in MEMORY.md after confirming revision is active.
```

**Trigger types:**
- `always` — inject with the next user prompt
- `session_end` — inject when wrap-up keywords are detected ("wrap up", "done", "end session")
- `after:N` — inject after N user prompts have been processed

The scheduler uses file locking to prevent race conditions when multiple hooks fire concurrently.

### Session Handoff Prompts

At the end of each session, Claude stores a structured prompt for the next session:

```python
db.insert_session_prompt("S42", "Continue work on Feature X. Group 3 complete, "
    "start Group 4 (Quick Actions). 4,539 tests, 0 failures.",
    context={
        "production_version": "1.58.3",
        "test_count": 4539,
        "test_failures": 0,
        "wis_implemented": [249, 251, 252],
        "next_tasks": ["WI #243", "WI #244"]
    })
```

The next session's hook automatically retrieves and displays this, then marks it as consumed.

---

## Step 4: Audit Cadence

Every Nth session (default: 5) is automatically flagged as an **audit session**. During wrap-up, the handoff generator checks and prepends audit instructions:

```python
AUDIT_INTERVAL = 5  # configurable

def is_audit_session(self, next_session_id, interval=None):
    n = self.parse_session_number(next_session_id)  # "S100" -> 100
    if n is None:
        return False
    return n % (interval or self.AUDIT_INTERVAL) == 0

def get_audit_directive(self):
    return (
        "AUDIT SESSION: Perform a fresh-context review before new work:\n"
        "1. Knowledge DB integrity - run assertions, check for status drift\n"
        "2. MEMORY.md and CLAUDE.md - accuracy, staleness, contradictions\n"
        "3. Repeatable Procedures - still accurate?\n"
        "4. Open design debt\n"
        "5. Hooks and scheduler - verify all hooks execute without errors\n"
        "Report findings before proceeding with regular work."
    )
```

This compensates for the inevitable context drift that accumulates across sessions.

---

## Step 5: CLAUDE.md + MEMORY.md Boundary

The database doesn't replace your markdown files — it complements them:

| File | Role | Content | Updates |
|------|------|---------|---------|
| **CLAUDE.md** | Rules & architecture | How to work: procedures, patterns, evaluation criteria | Rarely |
| **MEMORY.md** | State & history | What happened: versions, test counts, recent sessions | Every session |
| **Knowledge DB** | Specifications & assertions | Formal specs with machine-verifiable assertions | Every code change |

**Rule of thumb:** If it tells Claude *what to do*, it goes in CLAUDE.md. If it tells Claude *what has been done*, it goes in MEMORY.md. Formal specifications with machine-verifiable truth go in the database.

### CLAUDE.md Should Reference the DB

```markdown
### Knowledge Database
The Knowledge Database (`tools/knowledge-db/knowledge.db`) is the canonical
source of truth for all specifications. Claude is the sole writer. The owner
observes through the read-only web UI at localhost:8090.

Python API:
  db.get_spec("245")
  db.update_spec("245", changed_by="claude", change_reason="...", status="implemented")
  db.close()

When to update:
| Trigger | Action |
| Implement a WI | update_spec(id, status="implemented") |
| Verify a WI passes tests | update_spec(id, status="verified") |
| Discover a wrong status | update_spec(id, status=corrected) |
```

---

## Step 6: Read-Only Web UI

A simple Flask app provides the owner with visibility without giving them write access:

```python
# app.py — ~230 lines, runs at localhost:8090
from flask import Flask, render_template_string
from db import KnowledgeDB

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def index():
    db = KnowledgeDB()
    summary = db.get_summary()
    specs = db.list_specs()
    db.close()
    return render_template_string(TEMPLATE, summary=summary, specs=specs)
```

The owner sees all specs, their statuses, assertion results, and version history. They tell Claude what to fix; Claude creates a corrected version.

---

## Step 7: Seed Script

Bootstrap the database from your existing project artifacts:

```python
# seed.py — Run once to populate initial data
# IMPORTANT: Guard against accidental re-seeding
def main():
    db = KnowledgeDB()
    existing = db.get_summary()
    if existing["total"] > 0 and "--force" not in sys.argv:
        print(f"Database already has {existing['total']} specs. Use --force to re-seed.")
        sys.exit(1)

    # Load from whatever source you have (markdown backlog, JIRA export, etc.)
    for item in your_backlog:
        db.insert_spec(
            id=item["id"],
            title=item["title"],
            status="specified",
            changed_by="seed",
            change_reason="Initial import from backlog"
        )
    db.close()
```

---

## Recurring Instructions for CLAUDE.md

Add these to your project's CLAUDE.md so Claude maintains the database correctly across sessions:

```markdown
### Knowledge Database Maintenance

**Claude is the sole writer.** The owner observes through the read-only web UI.

**When to update the database:**

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Implement a work item | `update_spec(id, status="implemented", change_reason="...")` |
| Verify a WI passes tests | `update_spec(id, status="verified", change_reason="...")` |
| Discover a wrong status | `update_spec(id, status=corrected, change_reason="...")` |
| Complete a test procedure | Create new version via `insert_test_procedure()` |

**Assertion rules:**
- Valid assertion types: `grep`, `grep_absent`, `glob`
- Pass assertions as raw Python lists to `update_spec()` — it handles JSON serialization internally
- After adding new fields to schemas, update count assertions (test drift)
- Run assertions after every batch of changes

**Session wrap-up:** Store a handoff prompt via `db.insert_session_prompt()` so the next session starts with context.

**Audit cadence:** Every 5th session performs a fresh-context integrity review before new work.
```

---

## Lessons Learned (100 Sessions)

1. **The assertion runner is the single most valuable piece.** It turns "Claude remembers" into "Claude proves." Regressions caught at session start save hours of debugging.

2. **Append-only is not a limitation, it's a feature.** We never need to worry about lost data. At ~20 KB/session, storage is a non-issue for any realistic project lifetime.

3. **The double-serialization trap is real.** `update_spec(assertions=json.dumps([...]))` will double-encode because the method already calls `json.dumps()`. Always pass raw Python objects.

4. **Test drift is the #1 recurring failure mode.** When you add fields, enums, or schema entries, count-based assertions break. The fix is mechanical but easy to forget. The assertion runner catches it immediately.

5. **Session handoff prompts eliminate cold-start friction.** Instead of the human crafting "Continue work on X..." prompts, the previous session stores exactly what the next one needs.

6. **The 5-session audit cadence catches accumulated drift.** Individual sessions maintain the DB well, but small errors compound. Periodic fresh-context reviews are essential.

7. **MEMORY.md and CLAUDE.md still matter.** The database stores formal specs and assertions. The markdown files store patterns, preferences, and operational knowledge that don't fit a relational model.

8. **The read-only web UI builds trust.** The owner sees everything Claude knows without needing to read code or run scripts. This transparency is crucial for long-running commercial projects.

9. **Use a sentinel for "not provided" vs "set to None."** A bare `None` check cannot distinguish "caller omitted this argument" from "caller explicitly set it to None." A module-level `_UNSET = object()` sentinel resolves the ambiguity in merge logic.

10. **Index early.** As the database grows past ~100 specs, queries on `status`, `id`, and `changed_at` benefit noticeably from indexes. Add them in the schema creation, not as an afterthought.
