## What This Is

Membase is a **pattern** (not a library) for giving Claude Code durable memory that survives across sessions. It replaces fragile markdown backlogs with a structured, append-only SQLite database where every change is versioned and every claim is machine-verifiable.

Developed across 158 sessions on a commercial SaaS project, it solves three problems that emerge in long-running Claude Code projects:

1. **Context window saturation** — long sessions accumulate stale context that biases decisions.
2. **Session boundary amnesia** — each new session starts cold; CLAUDE.md and MEMORY.md help but drift over time.
3. **Undetected regression** — code changes silently break previously-verified behavior with no automated signal.

## How It Works

Claude is the **sole writer**. The human observes through a read-only web UI. The database stores 9 managed artifact types — specifications, tests, test plans, work items, backlog snapshots, operational procedures, documents, environment config, and testable elements — all under append-only change control. Machine-verifiable assertions (grep/glob checks against the actual codebase) run automatically at session start, catching regressions before work begins. A quality dashboard displays 4 key metrics (assertion coverage, test traceability, defect velocity, defect escape rate) at session start. A session handoff system eliminates cold-start friction by having each session store context for the next one.

The markdown files (CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md, topic files) still matter — they store rules, preferences, and operational patterns that don't fit a relational model. The database complements them with formal artifacts and machine-verifiable truth. The governance principle is simple: **if Claude references something, it must exist; if it exists, it must be under change control; if it's under change control, its history must be retrievable.** Key milestones include converting the entire Master Test Plan to live-only external interface testing (S133), achieving 99.5% machine-verifiable assertion coverage across 1,884 specifications (S146–S150), and implementing automated assertion pruning to keep the database compact (S158).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) (CLI)
- Python 3.10+
- SQLite 3 (included with Python)
- Flask (for the optional read-only web UI)

### Usage

1. Download [`MEMBASE-4-CLAUDE.md`](MEMBASE-4-CLAUDE.md) into your project
2. Ask Claude to read it:

```
Read MEMBASE-4-CLAUDE.md and set up the Membase knowledge database for this project.
```

That's it. The file contains the complete implementation pattern — schema, API, assertion runner, session hooks, governance principles, and web UI — with enough detail for Claude to reproduce it and adapt it to your project.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Seed example data, run assertions, start web UI
python reference/seed.py
python reference/assertions.py
pip install flask && python reference/app.py
```

See [`QUICKSTART.md`](QUICKSTART.md) for the full walkthrough including hook configuration and CLAUDE.md integration.

## Glossary of Key Terms

These terms have specific meanings in the Membase pattern. Understanding them is essential for working with the system.

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| **Specification** | A requirement — a business decision that affects customers or the business. Functions as a decision log (what was agreed and why), not a build specification. |
| **Test** | A testable assertion derived from a specification. Must produce an unambiguous PASS/FAIL. |
| **Test Plan** | An orchestrating artifact: ordered test phases with gate criteria. References test IDs without duplicating content. |
| **Work Item** | A unit of work classified by origin (regression, defect, new, hygiene) and component. |
| **Backlog Snapshot** | A point-in-time snapshot of active work items. A frozen record, not a living document. |
| **Assertion** | A machine-verifiable check (grep/glob) attached to a specification. Turns "Claude remembers" into "Claude proves." |
| **Phantom Artifact** | A concept referenced as if tracked, but with no backing storage or change control. The anti-pattern this system eliminates. |
| **Orchestrating Artifact** | An artifact that composes others by reference (ID only), never by content duplication. |
| **Governance Principle** | A process rule (GOV-\*) governing human-AI collaboration. 18 numbered rules (GOV-01–GOV-18) plus 2 architectural principles (Artifact Inventory, Orchestrating Artifact). Discovered through use, not designed upfront. |
| **Append-Only** | The change control discipline: no UPDATE, no DELETE. Every mutation creates a new versioned row. |
| **Session Handoff** | A structured prompt stored by one session for the next, eliminating cold-start friction. |
| **Protected Behavior** | A specification carrying machine-verifiable assertions that must always pass. |
| **Testable Element** | A UI component, form field, or interactive element inventoried for test coverage tracking. Stored in the `testable_elements` table with dimensional taxonomy (14 categories A–N). |
| **Quality Dashboard** | A 4-metric display rendered at session start: assertion coverage, test traceability, defect velocity, and defect escape rate. Provides immediate quality signal before work begins. |

## Benefits & Milestones

Membase was not designed upfront — it evolved through real project needs across 158 sessions. The milestones below trace how each capability was added in response to a specific problem.

### Evolution Timeline

| Session | Problem Encountered | Capability Added |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| S1–S95 | Markdown backlogs drift; concepts referenced but not tracked | — (markdown-only era) |
| S96 | No machine-verifiable truth about what's implemented | **Knowledge Database** — append-only SQLite, assertions, web UI |
| S104–S106 | Requirements scattered across 90 session transcripts | **Specification Discipline** — 871 specs extracted, governance principles crystallized |
| S109 | No way to measure which specs have tests | **Test Coverage** — `test_coverage` table, 1,230 test-to-spec mappings |
| S110 | Topic files contradict each other and the database | **GOV-08** — 30 topic files migrated to KB documents under change control |
| S112 | No way to measure which specs have tests | **Test Coverage Sprint** — 1,053 new tests, spec coverage 26% → 59% |
| S113–S114 | "Backlog" and "test plan" referenced but not actually tracked artifacts | **Artifact System Redesign** — 5 new tables, phantom artifacts eliminated |
| S116–S117 | Claude implements before recording specs from owner requirements | **GOV-09 + GOV-10** — spec-language detection hook (S116), tests must exercise production interfaces (S117) |
| S128 | Work items created without tests; no lifecycle tracking | **GOV-12** — work item creation triggers test creation; stage-gate transitions |
| S129 | Tests orphaned from test plan phases | **GOV-13** — test artifacts must be assigned to at least one test plan phase upon creation |
| S131 | UI changes break tests silently; tests fixed without approval; deploys without approval | **GOV-14–16** — UI element test sync, test fix approval gate, deployment approval gate |
| S133 | Mocked/inspection tests give false confidence; can't verify production behavior | **SPEC-1649** — Master Test Plan converted to live-only (13 active phases, 3 removed). All tests exercise external interfaces. |
| S135 | No systematic inventory of what should be tested in the UI | **SPEC-1652/1653** — Testable element inventory (520 elements), 4-phase quality cycle, dimensional taxonomy (14 categories A–N) |
| S135–S144 | Shallow live E2E tests miss real bugs | **936 live E2E tests** across 3 admin consoles (Standalone 576, Provider 264, Shopify 96), all exercising real staging APIs |
| S145 | No visibility into quality metrics at session start | **Quality Dashboard** (SPEC-1659/1660) — 4 metrics at every session start: assertion coverage, test traceability, defect velocity, defect escape rate |
| S146–S150 | 87% of specs lack machine-verifiable assertions | **Batch assertion generation** — 3-tier strategy (grep in known file, glob, keyword mapping). Coverage 12.9% → 99.5%. |
| S153 | Specs classified as "not yet implemented" that are actually implemented | **Verification mega-session** — 400 spec promotions, 148 retirements, GOV-18 (Assertion Quality Standard) |
| S157 | SPA console shares auth layer with tenant endpoints | **SPEC-1667/1668** — Complete SPA platform admin auth isolation with dedicated Cosmos collection and key prefix |
| S158 | assertion_runs table grows unboundedly (~230K rows, ~93 MB) | **Assertion pruning** — keeps latest 5 runs per spec, automated in SessionStart hook. DB 93 → 18 MB. Batch description enrichment (885 specs). |

### What the System Catches

- **Regressions at session start** — assertions run automatically before work begins, flagging any spec whose implementation has drifted
- **Phantom artifact references** — the database enforces that every referenced concept has backing storage and change control
- **Specification drift** — append-only versioning preserves the full decision history; nothing is silently overwritten
- **Cold-start amnesia** — session handoff prompts give each new session the context it needs without human re-explanation
- **Accumulated process drift** — every 5th session is an audit, catching errors that compound across sessions
- **Untested specifications** — `get_untested_specs()` identifies coverage gaps on demand

## Why Not Just Use Markdown?

The markdown-only approach (CLAUDE.md + MEMORY.md + topic files) works well for the first ~20 sessions. After that:

- Files grow unwieldy and contradictions accumulate
- There's no machine-verifiable way to know if what Claude "remembers" is still true
- MEMORY.md isn't version-controlled — there's no change history
- Claude can't partially load a document, so everything gets loaded every time
- Context window compaction makes drift worse, not better
- Claude silently "drifts," dropping memories and skipping procedures

Membase solves this by adding a structured layer with change control, versioned history, and automated verification — while keeping the markdown files for what they're good at (rules, preferences, operational patterns).

## Background

This pattern was developed incrementally on the [Agent Red Customer Experience](https://agentredcx.com) project by Remaker Digital. Working with an engineering team of one, the full weight of Agile and formal project management tools was unnecessary. What was needed was a shared, persistent, change-controlled memory between a human and an AI engineering partner.

The database is used exclusively by Claude and contains only what Claude needs to remember. The human observes through a lightweight read-only UI (sort, filter, search, tree-view, change history) that deliberately excludes write operations. When the human spots a discrepancy, they tell Claude, and Claude creates a corrected version.

The current database is ~18 MB (pruned from a 93 MB peak via automated assertion run cleanup) with 1,884 specifications, 8,888 test artifacts, 1 test plan (13 active phases, 3 removed), 1,126 work items, 13 operational procedures, 145 documents, 27 environment config entries, 520 testable elements, 1,874 specs with machine-verifiable assertions (99.5% coverage), and over 2,200 test-to-spec coverage mappings — all accumulated across 158 sessions with zero data loss.
